    Hello, I'm <span style="font-weight:800;">Aryan</span>.
</p>

<p>
    I'm a programmer, I build stuff;
</p>

<p>
I'm a software engineer with a focus on the <strong><u>backend, automation, and infrastructure</u></strong>  . And a keen spirit for writing code for humans & machines.
</p>

<p>
My primary tech stack includes <strong><u>Go, PHP, Docker, Kubernetes, Linux</u></strong>. Experienced with different cloud providers as well. I get the basic cloud thing. Also built some tools and services with Rust too. And it has became a new favorite. Prefer working on the low level stuff that is close to the processor and hardware.
</p>

<p>
Currently building fully managed infrastructure at <strong><u>DigitalOcean</u></strong>, onboard the <strong><u>App Platform team</strong></u>.
</p>

<!-- <p>
Sometimes I like to tinker with different tools, trying to build different things. Here I'm trying to implement TCP stack. And here, trying to build my own Kernel. Doesn't work though! But I got to learn some things.
